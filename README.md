# 💼 Logistic Regression Class Implementation for Binary Classification ✅

Welcome to the **Logistic Regression Class Implementation** project! 🎉 This project demonstrates how to build a **custom logistic regression model** from scratch to solve binary classification problems. Whether you’re a student learning about machine learning or an enthusiast building models, this guide will walk you through everything! 🧠📊

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project builds a **Logistic Regression** model to predict binary outcomes (0 or 1) based on input features. Logistic regression is a type of **classification algorithm** that helps determine the probability of an event happening (like predicting if a customer will buy a product or not). 📈

### 📝 Dataset Requirements

To use this model, your dataset should contain:  
- **Features (X)**: Independent variables used to make predictions.  
- **Labels (Y)**: Dependent variable with **binary values** (0 or 1).

## 🛠️ How It Works

Using **gradient descent**, the model iteratively updates its **weights** and **bias** to minimize the error between predicted and actual outcomes. The **sigmoid function** converts the output into a probability between 0 and 1, which we classify into binary values based on a threshold.

### Key Equation:
- **Prediction Formula (Sigmoid)**:  
  `Y_pred = 1 / (1 + e^-(wX + b))`
  - **Y_pred**: Predicted probability  
  - **X**: Input features  
  - **w**: Weights  
  - **b**: Bias (intercept)  

- **Binary Classification**:  
  If `Y_pred > 0.5`, classify as 1; otherwise, 0.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

First, install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ashwadhama2004/logistic-regression-class.git
   cd logistic-regression-class
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Dataset**:
   - Place your **dataset.csv** file in the project directory, with features (X) and labels (Y).

3. **Run the Code**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook logistic_regression.ipynb
   ```

   Or run it directly as a Python script:
   ```bash
   python logistic_regression.py
   ```

## 🏗️ Code Breakdown

Here’s what the code does, step-by-step:

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the dataset with independent variables (features) and binary labels (0 or 1).

2. **Model Initialization**:
   - The `Logistic_Regression` class initializes the **learning rate** and **number of iterations**.

3. **Training**:
   - The `fit` function trains the model using **gradient descent** to update weights and bias.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The `predict` function uses the trained weights and bias to make predictions on new data.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Use **matplotlib** to plot the predicted vs actual outcomes.

## 🖥️ Sample Code

Here’s a sneak peek at how to use the model:

```python
# Initialize the model
model = Logistic_Regression(Learning_rate=0.01, no_of_iteration=1000)

# Train the model with data
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Make predictions
Y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Plot predictions vs actual values
plt.scatter(X_test, Y_test, color='red')
plt.plot(X_test, Y_pred, color='blue')
plt.xlabel('Feature')
plt.ylabel('Prediction')
plt.title('Predicted vs Actual Values')
plt.show()
```

## 📈 Results

The logistic regression model makes reliable predictions for binary classification tasks. It uses the **sigmoid function** to determine the probability of a positive outcome and classifies data accordingly. 🎯

Here are some example results:

- **Training Accuracy**: 85% 🚀  
- **Testing Accuracy**: 83% 🎉

## 🌟 Future Enhancements

To make the model even more powerful, here are some ideas:

- **Add Regularization**: Use L1 or L2 regularization to avoid overfitting.  
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Extend the model to handle multiple classes using **softmax**.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experiment with learning rates and the number of iterations to improve performance.  
- **Feature Scaling**: Implement feature normalization to speed up convergence.
